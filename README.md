## ðŸ”¥ New version 2.2 "easy to use"! December 2023
âœ”  Now easily configurable as a web server or client

âœ”  Dynamic generation of QR codes. For Wifi settings and text input

If a connection to a known access point is possible, the ESP connects to it.

If no connection is possible, the ESP automatically switches to AP mode.
If you connect to this AP with your smartphone (QR code), you will be redirected to a WiFi configuration page in the ESP.
Here you can select an available WiFi SSID and enter the password. The data is stored in EEPROM.

If the box is connected to WiFi, the QR code on the display is used to reach the website.
Free text can then be entered here. (The text run absolutely smoothly, not like in the video)
The web server for this site can run externally at a host or internally on the ESP.
